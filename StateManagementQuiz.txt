1. Can post requests be bookmarked? What are the problems?
	No, because the bookmarke save only the URL, without any post parameters.
2. What is the purpose of request dispatching?
	is to forward the user to another servlet or jsp in same website
3. What is the difference between redirect and request dispatch?
	 forward
		• passes the request to another resource on the server
		• sometimes referred as “server side redirect“
		• request and response objects passed to destination servlet.
		• Browser is completely unaware of servlet forward and hence the URL
		  in browser address bar will remain unchanged
	 redirect
		• server sends HTTP status code 3xx to client along with the redirect
		  URL (usually 302 temporary redirect)
		• client then sends a new request to the URL
		• extra round trip
		• address bar will change to new URL
		• only http message sent, request and response objects cannot be sent
4. What is an attribute ?
	An object bound into one of the three servlet API objects
		• HttpServletRequest
		• HttpSession
		• ServletContext
5. What is the difference between attributes and parameters?
	attributes: provided and used from the server
	parameters: provided from the user and The Request object reads parameters from a submitted HTML
				form by reading the name property
6. What are dangers of using attributes?
	• Not thread safe, Only request attributes thread safe.
7. What does it mean to say that http is stateless? Give an example of a stateful protocol.
	stateless protocol means that after a web server responds to a request, there is no “memory” of the
	request or who sent it. 
	FTP is a stateful protocol.
8. Give 5 different methods for maintaining state information (count each attribute scope as one
method).
	• HttpServletRequest
	• HttpSession
	• ServletContext
	• Request Parameters
	• Cookies

9. How long does a session last?
	depending on The session timeout, typically from 15 to 30 minutes.
10. What is a cookie, and how long does a cookie last?
	cookie is set of data saved on the user browser
	• temporary cookie
		• browser removes when it closes
		• this is default
		• session cookies are like this
	• permanent cookie
		• a cookie that has a max age set
11. What is the purpose of URL rewriting?
	Url rewriting is a process of appending or modifying any url structure while loading a page
12. Why does the request attribute report ‘null’ for the maintaining state demo?
	because doGet is a deffrence request than the doPost, that means you can set a request attribute on doGet and expect to find it in the doPost
