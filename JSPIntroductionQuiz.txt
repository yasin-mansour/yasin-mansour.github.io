1. What is the main value of Java Server Pages?
    separate display from processing, i.e., separate html from java
2. How are JSP pages related to servlets?
    JSP life cycle is similar to the servlet life cycle with an additional step of compiling a JSP into servlet.
3. How are JSP pages related to HTML?
    Jsp is html with a little java mixed in.
4. Give an example of a JSP scriptlet and show how it will look in the JSP servlet .
    <% count++; %>, count++;
5. Give an example of a JSP declaration and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
    <%! int count = 0; %>, int count = 0;
6. Give an example of a JSP comment and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
    <%-- jsp comment --%>, <!â€“ jsp Comment -->
7. Give an example of a JSP expression and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
    <%= count++; %>, System.out.print(count++);
8. Give an example of a JSP directive and show how it will look in the JSP servlet.
    <%@ page import="java.util.Date" %>, import java.util.Date;
9. Explain how an EL expression is evaluated.
    evaluates the expression and writes it out to the HTML page at its location on the page
10. Explain how servlet attributes are involved in EL expressions.
11. Explain how servlets and JSPs use request dispatch to interact.
    Typical implementation introduces just one servlet which generically dispatches requests to JSP handling code. (This is the approach of the Struts framework.)
